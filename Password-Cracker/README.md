Spend time trying to compromise passwords
Use whatever language / techniques you want

Turn in: A zip file named as your NetID (e.g. ab123) containing the following:
  Three text files (one for each password list) where each line contains the original line from the password file and the plaintext password separated by a space.  
  Files containing all the source code used.
  A pdf file explaining:
    The technique you used to obtain the passwords.
    Other techniques you considered.
    How were the passwords stored? Compare the difficulty in cracking passwords protected with each type of storage.

Due before class next week!
